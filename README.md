# GitHub README for the Python-Data-Visuals Repository

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skill in quickly cleaning data and formatting it into easy to understand visuals using the Python coding language, as well as several software packages including pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The project I have used to showcase these skills “Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Data with Python” can be found on the Coursera website [here](https://www.coursera.org/projects/perform-exploratory-data-analysis-on-retail-data-with-python).

For this project I have been assigned by a fictional online retail company based in the United Kingdom to clean, analyze, and visualize their data in order to answer several questions about the company. To complete this assignment I have performed a complete analysis of the company's data using python and jupyter notebooks.

In order to show how I have completed this project successfully, I have added five different files to this repository. Four are .png image files meant to display the visuals I have created using python. The other file is an .ipynb file that displays the python code I have written in jupyter notebook.

***A Brief Explanation of the Repository Files***

**Online Retail Python Data Viz Project.ipynb** – This jupyter notebook file displays the majority of the project on this repository. In this file you can see my code for:
- Importing python software and the excel file for the project's data frame
- Checking the data frame to discover null values, duplicate rows and unnecessary columns
- Removing null values, duplicate rows, and unnecessary columns from the data frame
- Creating a new column “SalePrice” that displays the total of the two columns “Quantity” and “UnitPrice”
- Creating data visuals that display relevant information to the company

**MonthByMonthSales.png** – Image file that displays the first data visual created in this project. Shows the total monthly sales from December 2010 to December 2011 using a line graph.

**BusiestTime.png** – Image file that displays the second data visual created in this project. Shows the busiest time of day on average for online purchases using a bar graph.

**TopTenProductsSold.png** – Image file that displays the third data visual created in this project. Shows the top ten products sold using a horizontal bar graph.

**TopTenSellingPieChart.png** – Image file that displays the fourth data visual in this project. Shows the top ten selling products in a pie chart. _Quick Note: I made this data visual mostly to explore and play around with python's abilty to create fun and engaging data visuals._
